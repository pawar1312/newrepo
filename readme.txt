Passwords

Misc remarks
------------
Linux distros differ with regard to their password behavior.
By default all passwords are set to "password" in our images.

If there is an additional administrative password for the standard user,
like in the Ubuntu distros, it is also set to "password".

If logging in as root doesn't work with "password", it is most
likely the default installation of the distro that prohibits logging
in as root.
